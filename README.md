This is a basic calculator written using the visitor pattern of antlr. 
Grammar was taken from [here](https://github.com/shmatov/antlr4-calculator/blob/master/Calculator.g4)


I could not find a working example using go visitor. 
I don't think I am supposed to write this calculator the way
it is written. But after spending couple of hours trying to
make it work and browsing through antlr go runtime (which is really horrible)
this is my output.
